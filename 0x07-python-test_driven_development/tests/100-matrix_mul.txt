 How to Use 100-matrix_mul.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``matrix_mul()``.

Importing the function from the module:
	  >>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul

Checking regular matrix multiplication:
	 >>> matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
	 [[7, 10], [15, 22]]
